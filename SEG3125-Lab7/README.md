# Lab6

## Requirements
* Design a site of your choice (must meet criteria)
* Create prototypes of site
* Include in UI an element of design for each of the usability heuristics

* **Module 3 on prototyping**
  * Paper sketches, or
  * Mock-up/wireframe
* **Module 6 on interactive processes**
  * Need to make a site containing at least 4 different processes
* **Module 7 on heuristic evaluation**

### Requirements for site
* Site must include at least 4 different processes out of the 8 interactive processes presented in the vids of module 6:
  * follow instructions
  * absorb information
  * do supervised activity
  * etc.
* Site must contain a design element linked to each usability heuristic

### Requirements for design report
* Introduce the name of company/organization
* Provide a description of the purpose of this site and its intended users
* Explain which interactive processes will be featured (at least 4)
* Show sketch/mock-up for each process
  * Name these sketches (sketch 1, 2...) so that you can refer to them in your point 5
* For each usability heuristic (10 of them):
  * Explain which design element in a sketch is related to this heuristic
  * 

## Inspiration


## Peergrade questions
* Do you find the idea of the site interesting? Is this a site you would like to use?
* Has the designer provided a description of the site and potential users?
* What do you think of the title of the site? Catchy? Original?
* Are there 4 different processes defined?
* What do you think of the choice of processes? Are they well suite to the associated actions (according to the descriptions given)?
* Did the designer provide the necessary sketches to fully understand the interactive processes planned?
* What is the quality of the sketches provided?
* Does the designer provide elements of their UI for all 10 heuristics?
* Is it easy to find the elements associated with the various heuristics on the sketches?
* What is the overall appreciation of the designer's work? Grade from 1 to 5
