## Requirements
* Build a site for a health service business that respects the following design principles:
  * Visibility
    * The following information must be **present and visible**
      * **Health clinic information**
        * Which site the user is on (logo, image, etc.)
        * Location (health service address)
        * Services offered + prices (no bad surprises; at least 5 services)
        * Who are the experts? Describe at least 3
      * **Health clinic possible user actions**
        * Selection of a service
        * Selection of a date and time
        * Enter contact information
  * Consistency
    * Aesthetic consistency
      * Decide on which elements in page will create a consistent look
      * Decide on the meaning of each font + color in page to improve consistency
      * Fonts have moods: change font maybe?
    * Functional consistency
      * External
        * Using bootstrap components gives you consistency of known functionality (lists + buttons)
        * Use of standard navigation patterns
      * Internal
        * Bootstrap suggests color choices to express different types of messages (success, warning, danger, etc.)
        * Can adapt color choices

* Health service business is one of the following 2 options:
  * Physiotherapy business
  * Veterinary business

* In website:
  * There is physical address to go to
  * You must make an appointment for a service
  * Several services are offered (TMJ Pain, Custom Knee Brace, Vestibular Rehab for physiotherapy or Surgery, Preventive Care, Dentistry for the Veterinary clinics)

## Peergrade questions:
* Is it clear which site you are on?
  * Title + logo that both stand out

* Can easily see health service address so you can get to appointment
  * Easy to find address

* Can easily see 5 services offered
  * All 5 services persent + easily visible

* Can easily see 3 experts who work at the clinic
  * All 3 experts are present + easily visible

* Can see how to select a service clearly

* Can see how to select date + time for appointment clearly

* Can see how to enter contact information

* Are standard user input components (buttons + checkboxes + lists + text area) used the same way they would be in other sites to assure that functional external **consistency** is present?

* Choice of colors associated with particular meanings and used in a coherent way? There should be colors for creating the "mood", not all colors need to mean something

* Choice of fonts or size of fonts associated with particular meanings and used in a coherent way (can also be fonts for creating the mood not all colors need to mean smt)
